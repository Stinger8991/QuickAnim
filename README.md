# QuickAnim
A Simple Blender tool to speed up the animation process
A pie menu which helps you switch between local , global , move and rotation rootls , and adding key frames for rotation and position. 

Its a tool more for ease of use and speed, than anything revolutionary

You will add the tool to a hotkey. Ive used Shift Q for it but you woulc use any hotkey to access the pie menu.

Add the hotkey to 3D view Generic in your settings/keymap.

the identifer is wm.call_menu_pie
the name of the pie menu is quick.pie
