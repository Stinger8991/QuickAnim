# QuickAnim
A Simple Blender tool to speed up the animation process
A pie menu which helps you switch between local , global , move and rotation rootls , and adding key frames for rotation and position. 

Its a tool more for ease of use and speed, than anything revolutionary

You will need to install it as usual for blender add ons.
You will also have to add the tool to a hotkey. Ive used Shift Q for it but you could use any hotkey to access the pie menu.

Add the hotkey to 3D view Generic in edit/preferances/keymap.

the identifer is wm.call_menu_pie
the name of the pie menu is quick.pie
